## Odin Project - Binary Search Tree
Odin Project assignment to build a balanced binary search tree and implement various functions that allow user to perform different actions on the tree: insert, delete values, traverse the tree in different ways, perform tree balancing etc.

## Notes

The tree class contains not only functions used to perform actions on the tree itself, but also some internal helper functions that are only used by other functions.

## Learning experience

This was a particularly challenging task since I was very new to recursive functions and their equivalents using while() loop AND using them on completely new topic that I never dealt with before: binary search trees.
